A little app is a proof-of-concept, meant to some day help out to maintain a better track of incoming/outgoing products via a hand held barcode reader (model Memor X3 by Datalogic) in a small family company. It made some API calls in a couple of screens to a Linux server running Apache2, MariaDB and a bit of PHP. Keep in mind the device had only like .NET 2.0 or something with WindowsCE 6 if remember right. It saw only a bit of development usage, cos the barcode reader's screen turned out to be too little and the project got canceled.
